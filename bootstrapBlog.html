        <p>
          This blogg is about telling people how to cope with life abroad...
          I did something completely out of character for myself. I joined a creative group.

          My group of creatives are fantastic! We meet every other Thursday, and we work on the book, The Artist’s Way. It’s a book used to help your creative process. There’s a ton of exercises in there and I’ve tried to do most of them.

          One of the exercises was writing two letters to yourself. The first is a letter from your eighty year old self to you now. The second, to write a letter to your eight year old self.

          Wow. What an amazing exercise. I highly recommend doing this. If you wrote a letter to yourself, what would you say?

          I was so surpised by what I wrote. The support and encouragement I gave myself was incredible. I wanted to share them with you:
